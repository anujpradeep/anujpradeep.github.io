!---------------------------------Question 1---------------------------------!
The main advantages for Static Site generators like Pelican performance and simplicity.
Static pages are much faster than dynamic ones, as they don't have a lot of server side processing. As the pages are HTML, CSS and Javascript, it can be cached and served faster. 
It is also simple to create and maintain these sites as mentioned above, just HTML, CSS, Javascript and can be created using markdown or other markup languages.

One of the disadvantages for Static Site generators are the build times for larger static sites with multiple pages.
Another would be as there isn't any dynamic components, the user experience could be neglected as its not very user intractable. The sites can also not access things like databases.
